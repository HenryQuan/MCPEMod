# 2020
6 years already. I really miss my old days maybe because I am staying at home too much. It brings all my memories back to me. You don't really have a chance like this where you can take a break and rest. I feel like the time stops this year.

I am coming back as well. I still enjoy making mods/tweaks and it is just fun for me. Doing what you like is a nice thing in life.

# 2018
Now is 2018. This brings back memory. *This was my game hacking era.*

Lots of things happened since this but I have no regret choosing this path. 
I am now scared of failing and don't dare to challenge myself anymore. If you could do this 4 years ago, is it really that hard? You just dont want to put in any efforts...

# MCPE Mod
This is only for Minecraft PE 0.9.4 - 0.10.0. I haven't tried recent versions but I don't think it will work anymore.

It has a setting bundle but the language you will see in `Settings` will be only in Chinese >_<

~~*It will support Multi-langague one day and keep updating.*~~ Sadly, this never happened.
